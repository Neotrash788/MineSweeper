# MineSweeper
The objective is to flag all bombs withouht any false positaves unlike clasic minesweeper where if you reveal all spaces which are not mines you win.

Right click → Flag\
Left Click → Place Guess\
Space → View probability\
Darker tiles means more likelyhood to be a mine\
Clicking in a tile which has all the flags in place will automatically guess all of its surrounding tiles

LINES 59 AND 60 (in Main.py) can be used to change the dimensions of the board and the number of mines\
(Length, Height, Mines)\
